My name is Jaedyn Okabe and I am a third year undergraduate student at Queen's university in Canada pursuing a Bachelors of Computing with a focus on security. I am very interested in the cybersecurity field and hoping to be able to get work experience in the industry through a internship or co-op starting May 2024. 

Some related coursework that I have taken is Database Management Systems (PHP & SQL), Intro Computer Science I & II (Python & Java), Computer Architecture (C & Assembly), Data Structures (Python), and System-level Programming (Bash & C).

You can find me consistently participating in CTFs throughout the year while I prepare to take my eJPTv2 exam. I am also consistently practicing on TryHackMe, [RingZer0][RingZer0], HackTheBox, and OverTheWire. On TryHackMe I have complete the following learning paths: [Intro to Cyber Security](https://jaedyno15.github.io/ctf_writeups/assets/certifications/intro_cyber_security_THM_certificate.png), [Pre Security](https://jaedyno15.github.io/ctf_writeups/assets/certifications/pre_security_THM_certificate.png), [Web Fundamentals](https://jaedyno15.github.io/ctf_writeups/assets/certifications/web_fundamentals_THM_certificate.png), [SOC Level 1](https://jaedyno15.github.io/ctf_writeups/assets/certifications/SOC_level1_THM_certificate.png), [Cyber Defense](https://jaedyno15.github.io/ctf_writeups/assets/certifications/cyber_defense_THM_certificate.png), [Complete Beginner](https://jaedyno15.github.io/ctf_writeups/assets/certifications/complete_beginner_THM_certificate.png), [CompTIA Pentest+](https://jaedyno15.github.io/ctf_writeups/assets/certifications/compTIA_Pentest+_THM_certificate.png) and [Jr Penetration Tester](https://jaedyno15.github.io/ctf_writeups/assets/certifications/jr_penetration_tester_THM_certificate.png).

On CTFTime I mainly participate for the team [Inodes](https://ctftime.org/team/214260) or you can see my personal stats here [jae03](https://ctftime.org/user/154304). I am currently ranked in the top 50 overall in Canada and in the top 2500 global on TryHackMe.
