My name is Jaedyn Okabe and I am a second year at Queen's university in Canada pursuing a Bachelors of Computing with a focus in security.I am very interested in the cybersecurity field and hoping to be able to get work experience in the field during a internship or co-op. 

Some related coursework that I have taken is Database Management Systems (PHP & SQL), Intro Computer Science I & II (Python & Java), Computer Architecture (C & Assembly), Data Structures, and System-level Programming (Bash & C).

You can find me consistently participating in CTFs throughout the year while I prepare to take my eJPTv2 exam. I am also consistently practicing on TryHackMe, RingZer0, and OverTheWire. 

On CTFTime I mainly participate for the team [Inodes](https://ctftime.org/team/214260) or you can see my personal stats here [jae03](https://ctftime.org/user/154304). 

If you would like to reach out, add me on discord jae03#8078 or email me at jaedyn.okabe@gmail.com
