My name is Jaedyn Okabe and I am a third year undergraduate student at Queen's university in Canada pursuing a Bachelors of Computing with a concentration on security. I am very interested in cybersecurity and hoping to get work experience within the industry through an internship or co-op starting May 2024. 

Some related coursework that I have taken is Database Management Systems (PHP & SQL), Intro Computer Science I & II (Python & Java), Computer Architecture (C & Assembly), Data Structures (Python), and System-level Programming (Bash & C).

I am consistently participating in CTFs throughout the year while I prepare to take my eJPTv2 exam. I am also practicing on TryHackMe, [RingZer0][RingZer0], HackTheBox, and [OverTheWire][OverTheWire]. I primarily participate with the team [Inodes](https://ctftime.org/team/214260) for CTFs; you can find my individual stats here: [jae03](https://ctftime.org/user/154304).

On TryHackMe I am currently among the top 50 users in Canada and have complete the following learning paths: [Intro to Cyber Security](https://jaedyno15.github.io/ctf_writeups/assets/certifications/intro_cyber_security_THM_certificate.png), [Pre Security](https://jaedyno15.github.io/ctf_writeups/assets/certifications/pre_security_THM_certificate.png), [Web Fundamentals](https://jaedyno15.github.io/ctf_writeups/assets/certifications/web_fundamentals_THM_certificate.png), [SOC Level 1](https://jaedyno15.github.io/ctf_writeups/assets/certifications/SOC_level1_THM_certificate.png), [Cyber Defense](https://jaedyno15.github.io/ctf_writeups/assets/certifications/cyber_defense_THM_certificate.png), [Complete Beginner](https://jaedyno15.github.io/ctf_writeups/assets/certifications/complete_beginner_THM_certificate.png), [CompTIA Pentest+](https://jaedyno15.github.io/ctf_writeups/assets/certifications/compTIA_Pentest+_THM_certificate.png), and [Jr Penetration Tester](https://jaedyno15.github.io/ctf_writeups/assets/certifications/jr_penetration_tester_THM_certificate.png).
